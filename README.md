# ExampleBotFeedback 2.0

Example of a Teletone bot for feedback

This is the best feedback bot because you don't even need a database. For small projects

# Preparation

Rename the env file to .env

Now change the environment variables in .env:

- **BOT_TOKEN** - your bot token
- **BOT_ADMIN_ID** - user id of the bot administrator
- **DB_FILE** - Database storage file (data is saved in json)

Install dependencies:

`composer install`

# Run

Run from console:

`php bot.php`

Yay!
